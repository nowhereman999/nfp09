This is a collection of notes I'm maintaining while doing the
updating work.

The main assembly file that will be built by asm6809 is nfp09.s.  This file
will include the individual updated .s files in the correct order.

Note that since asm6809 does not have multi-object linking, all symbols
end up in the same namespace.  Therefore, we need to create our own
local namespaces in each file by tweaking the symbol names.

FILES THAT HAVE BEEN CONVERTED:
- comp.sa
- equates.sa
- frnbak.sa
- getput.sa
- procs.sa
- rndexep.sa
- util.sa

MAJOR TODO ITEMS:
- I have found some for-sure bugs and some maybe bugs.  They're
  tagged with XXXJRT and I need to file Issues for them.
- I have also found some opportunities for optimization that are
  present after removing the macro-ized IF-ELSE-ENDIF stuff.  Those
  locations are also tagged with XXXJRT.
- There are equates in equates.s that will be interpreted as octal
  numbers by asm6809; verify that is the intent.
