This is a collection of notes I'm maintaining while doing the
updating work.

The main assembly file that will be built by asm6809 is nfp09.s.  This file
will include the individual updated .s files in the correct order.

Note that since asm6809 does not have multi-object linking, all symbols
end up in the same namespace.  Therefore, we need to create our own
local namespaces in each file by tweaking the symbol names.

MAJOR TODO ITEMS:
- Replace the IF-ENDIF constructs in the original code.  They are
  currently preserved as-is.  Those were implemented as assembler
  macros in the original, but asm6809's macro support cannot replicate
  them.
- Ditto with IFTST.
- Ditto with IFCC.
- Ditto with WHILE-ENDWH
- Ditto with REPEAT-UNTIL
